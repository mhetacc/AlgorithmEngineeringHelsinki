\chapter{Intersection Algorithms\label{intersect}}

In this chapter we are going to see a collection of algorithms to compute the intersection of two sorted lists, and all of them are taken from the chapter six of "Pearl of Algorithm Engineering" by Paolo Ferragina, published by Cambridge University Press \citep{Ferragina_2023}. \\
That being said, we will first look at two of the most commonly used search algorithms around, since we cannot interest two arrays without knowing how to search in them. \\
