\chapter{Conclusions\label{conclusions}}

As we were able to see in the previous chapters, especially in the comparison tables in section \brref{sec:smalladaptive}, out of the many algorithms available the best ones are often the simplest, keeping true to the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle}{KISS} principle: in both tables \brref{fig:birbay2} and \brref{fig:birbay3} the best performing solutions are \textit{SvS} or its variations, and frequently the preferred searching algorithm is either \textit{Binary search} or \textit{Galloping}, both of which are not particularly exotic. \\
Moreover, straightforward solutions offer a significant advantage: they are easy to implement since they are easy to understand, which is just as important as being efficient and effective. This pattern can be observed in other domains, such as distributed systems, where the \textit{Raft} algorithm for consensus \citep{raft} won over its predecessor \textit{Paxos} \citep{paxos} thanks to its simplicity and ease of understanding.
