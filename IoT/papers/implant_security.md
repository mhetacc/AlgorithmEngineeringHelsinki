## Abstract

Doctors and patients are now using their smart-phones to control and monitor implantable medical devices (IMDs) such as cardiac implants, insulin pumps, deep brain neurostimulators, etc. via the Internet or Bluetooth connections.

reliance on software also results in exposure to several security threats

However, there have been very few real attempts to hack such devices and harm patients

We investigate the practical security risks involved with the use of IMDs and the motivations for an attacker to hack these devices. 

## Introduction

An IMD is implanted in the patient's body, either in parts or completely, surgically or medically, for short or extended periods of time. These devices can range from standalone medical devices to devices that are capable of connecting to a network [and] can significantly help in controlling and monitoring the patient's condition for a wide range of diseases such as diabetes, Parkinsons, cardiac arrhythmia, and so on. Implanted pacemakers, insulin pumps, cardioverter defibrillators, and neurostimulators are the most commonly used IMDs. 

cardioverter defibrillators can automatically generate electric shocks when the heart is sensed to not beat properly. IMDs can even interact with the sensors not directly connected with the IMD. These may even be outside the patient's body. For example, a glucose sensor inserted under the skin may continuously sense the glucose level in the patient's body and wirelessly communicate with the insulin pump to maintain the required glucose level 

In general, attacks on the Internet of Things (IoT) systems and devices are also applicable to IMDs ([Alvarenga & Tanev, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670720307708#bib0065))
